Love me tender, love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so

Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always will

Love me tender, love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And will never part

Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always will

Love me tender, love meâ€¦
